# Connections and Forwards

Use the Sessions, Connection Pool, Connection Monitor, Host Tools, graphics/VNC, and forwarding surfaces for normal SSH work. The CLI companion is only for headless validation, export, and repeatable setup.

## Saved Connections

Saved connections hold reusable SSH profile data: name, host, user, port, group, tags, color, authentication mode, and optional post-connect command.

Create and edit saved connections from the connection manager or Sessions view. For a new host, fill in the profile, choose an authentication mode, save it, then open the connection from Sessions. If the connection fails, edit the same saved profile instead of creating duplicate entries with similar labels.

Use groups, colors, and tags for navigation. Do not put passwords, tokens, or environment secrets in names, groups, tags, notes, or post-connect labels.

## Importing Connections

Open Settings, go to Connections, and use **Import from Other Clients**. Select a source, choose its file or folder, review the preview, then import the selected connections. Existing names can be skipped or renamed, and an optional target group can override source groups.

Supported sources and inputs:

| Source | Input |
|--------|-------|
| SecureCRT | Session `.ini` files, a Sessions folder, or a SecureCRT `.xml` export |
| Xshell | `.xsh` files, a Sessions folder, or an `.xts` archive |
| Termius | Exported JSON |
| MobaXterm | `.mxtsessions` export |
| WindTerm | `user.sessions` JSON |
| Electerm | Bookmarks JSON containing `bookmarkGroups` and `bookmarks`, or a legacy bookmark array |
| FinalShell | The `conn` folder, or the FinalShell data folder that contains `conn` |

OxideTerm imports safe connection metadata such as names, groups, hosts, ports, usernames, and supported key-file paths. Passwords, passphrases, embedded private keys, certificates, proxy credentials, and other secret values are not imported. Unsupported proxy, jump-host, and forwarding settings are shown as preview warnings. Configure authentication and review those advanced settings in OxideTerm after the metadata import.

## Connection Runtime

Saved profiles and live runtime nodes are different things:

- Saved profile: the host and connection settings OxideTerm should use.
- SSH node: the live or reconnecting runtime state for a host.
- Terminal session: a visible shell attached to an SSH node.
- SFTP session: a file browsing or transfer surface attached to an SSH node.
- Host Tools snapshot: a resource view sampled through the owning SSH node.
- Graphics/VNC session: a viewer backed by a saved RDP/VNC profile or a node-owned graphics runtime.

Use Connection Pool and Connection Monitor when a terminal looks stuck, SFTP cannot read a directory, Host Tools look stale, a graphics/VNC viewer disconnects, or reconnect behavior is unclear. Reconnect the runtime from the app state; do not delete and recreate the saved profile just to reconnect.

## Connecting

Typical flow:

1. Open Sessions.
2. Select a saved connection or create one.
3. Open the connection.
4. Wait for the SSH node and terminal tab to become live.
5. If needed, open SFTP, IDE, Host Tools, or forwarding from the same connected node, or open a saved RDP/VNC profile.

For unstable hosts, keep Connection Monitor open while testing. It shows whether a node is connected, connecting, stale, or unavailable.

## Host Tools

Host Tools are node-level views for inspecting the remote environment. Use them for processes, Docker, services, tmux, packages, logs, ports, filesystems, scheduled tasks, and metrics.

Resource snapshots can become stale independently of the terminal tab. Refresh the Host Tools page or reconnect the owning node before retrying actions. Host Tools actions should remain explicit and reviewable; do not use them as hidden background cleanup.

## Graphics And VNC

Graphics/VNC sessions are visual app surfaces backed either by a saved RDP/VNC profile or by a connected node's graphics runtime. They are useful when a remote workflow needs a desktop or graphical application rather than terminal output.

The viewer state is separate from terminal scrollback. If a profile-backed viewer disconnects, reconnect its provider/helper; if a node-launched viewer disconnects, reconnect or restart it from the node context. Do not duplicate a saved SSH profile just to repair a viewer.

## Serial Terminals

Serial terminals are local device transports, not SSH subfeatures. Use them for USB-UART adapters, development boards, router consoles, switch consoles, or other local serial devices.

Open a serial terminal from the New Connection dialog by selecting the `Serial` branch. Fill in `Serial port`, `Baud rate`, `Data bits`, `Stop bits`, `Parity`, and `Flow control`, then choose `Open Serial`. The command palette also exposes `Open Serial Terminal`.

Common port names:

| Platform | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| macOS | `/dev/cu.usbserial-0001`, `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` |
| Linux | `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyACM0` |
| Windows | `COM3`, `COM10` |

Use `Save serial profile` and `Profile name` when the same device settings should be reused. Saved serial profiles are separate from saved SSH connections.

Serial terminals do not provide SFTP, port forwarding, ProxyJump, SSH host-key verification, SSH Agent, remote IDE, or SSH connection-pool behavior. Serial split panes are disabled because a serial device is normally an exclusive writer.

## Port Forwards

Use the forwarding UI to create and manage local, remote, and dynamic forwards.

Forward types:

- Local: a local port connects through SSH to a remote target.
- Remote: a remote port connects back to a local target.
- Dynamic: a SOCKS-style tunnel.

Attach forwards to the owning connection so their lifecycle is clear. Enable auto-start only for forwards that should start whenever the connection opens. When testing a new forward, confirm both the forwarding row and the owning connection are healthy.

## Validation And Export

Use the app to inspect visible connection and forward state. Use the CLI companion for CI, reviewable exports, or support workflows:

```sh
oxideterm connections validate --strict
oxideterm connections export --format raw-safe --json
oxideterm forwards validate --json
```

`raw-safe` output is intended for review and automation without credential values.
